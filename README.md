# real_estate_prediction
Predicting the real estate prices in Estonia as the Introduction to Data Science course project in the University of Tartu (2021).

## Contents of the repository

* In the file _scraper.ipynb_, our web scraper notebook can be seen with some examples of the data we were able to scrape.
* The notebook _data_analysis.ipynb_ shows how we cleaned the data and tried to find interesting correlations.
* In the _models.ipynb_ file we read in the previously cleaned data and trained some machine learning models to best predict the real estate prices.

In addition, we created a simple web application to demonstrate our work. This app allows the user to make guesses about the prices of some random real estate listing and see how the model predicted the price.

Feel free to browse around and look at the raw data and other files, such as a report made for the practical session of the Introduction to Data Science course.
